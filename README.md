## a8-building-applications

For this assignment, you will create a repository in which you build your own shiny application. The application should provide users with the ability to interact with a visual representation of the  iris  dataset (more info below). What the application looks like is up to you, as long as it meets the following requirements:

. There is a  sidePanel  in which you've created at least two widgets that change the visual output in your application
. One of your widgets must change the data that is being displayed. For example, the attribute being shown on the x or y axis. Simply changing the color of the markers would not meet this requirement.
. You must create a visual representation of a dataset that reacts to the widgets in the  sidePanel 
. You must push your application up to the  shinyapps.io  server, making it publically usable
. A  Readme.md  file, because it's important to document your code. This file should contain a link to your project.

A scatter-plot with 2 widgets controlling the x variable and y variable would be sufficient. 

####Visual representation

The  mainPanel  of your application should contain a visual representation of the  iris  dataset. The visualization can be made with base R graphics, plotly, or something less supported but more interesting. While we don't expect you to create anything ground-breaking, we do expect you to create a clear visualization with proper labels. And of course, the graphic needs to react to changing values in the widgets.

###Submission


1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> Rosemary and Joycie

2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

> 5 or 6 

3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

> 6.5 or so; I really didn't get the connection between the UI and the server with input and output and everything

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> Maybe more thoroughly explain the input-output connection
